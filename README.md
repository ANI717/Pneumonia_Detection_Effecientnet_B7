# Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-ray Image with EfficientNet-B7
Google has published both a very exciting paper and source code for a newly designed CNN called EfficientNet, that set new records for both accuracy and computational efficiency over most popular CNNs on ImageNet dataset. I have used the EfficientNet (EfficientNet-B7) to solve a classsification problem, detection of Pneumonia in Chest X-ray images.
